# parser-backend

This is a flask server set up to allow for server-to-server communication with Lever.co's resume parsing API. 

For a live demo, check out my website [here](https://itsjafer.com/#/parser).

The purpose of this overall project was to see how well my resume as well as my friends' resumes were being parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems in Job Applications.
