# parser-backend

This is a flask server set up to allow for server-to-server communication with Lever.co's resume parsing API.

Originally, this server was hosted using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Since then, the functionality was migrated to AWS Lambda with API Gateway to save on costs. That repo is hosted at [github.com/itsjafer/resume-parser](http://github.com/itsjafer/resume-parser).

For a live demo, check out my website [here](https://itsjafer.com/#/parser).

The purpose of this overall project was to see how well my resume as well as my friends' resumes were being parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems in Job Applications.
